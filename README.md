This is a [Y-Sweet](https://jamsocket.com/y-sweet) application scaffold. Y-Sweet leverages [Yjs Shared Data Types](https://docs.yjs.dev/) to sync state across multiple clients.

## Getting started

1. `npm install`

2. Create a Y-Sweet service on [the Jamsocket dashboard](https://app.jamsocket.com).

3. Create a connection string on your Y-Sweet service's page.

4. Run the application with your connection string:

```bash
CONNECTION_STRING=[your connection string] npm run dev
```

You can learn more about Y-Sweet and how it integrates into your application in our [Y-Sweet Quickstart](https://docs.jamsocket.com/y-sweet/quickstart).

Y-Sweet is built and maintained by [Jamsocket](https://jamsocket.com).
